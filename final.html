			<p id="film"> </p> <h3>An Evening with Maria Lassnig: World Premiere of 70s Avant-Garde Films</h3>
		
			<p>Two former art students of Maria Lassnig presented the world premiere of her restored original avant garde film collection from the 1970s.</p> 

			<p>“‘An Evening with Maria Lassnig” on Jan. 29 at the Museum of Modern Art showcases the restoration of the 1970s avant-garde scene and demonstrates artistic pieces of the city’s history that were once stored in a battered cardboard box.</p>

		  	 <p> Lassnig’s voice projects over a tape as she describes her art as “body awareness,” which is notion of working with art to express the physical and mental awareness of human beings. Her work expresses both physical and spiritual self-love and reflection. This includes a stop motion animation of her self portrait speaking on life and how she ended up in New York. Clips featured her Austrian female friends, strolling through European gardens and dancing feverishly to the orchestrations of Andrew Weber in a symphony of feminine power. Many of these films, “Iris,” “Hilde,” and “Alice,” showcase the power of sensitivity in women. One film and song number,“The Ballad of Maria Lassnig,”was a music video dedicated to the stages of her life to a sarcastic children’s tune. Her narrations and jokes on life’s ironies and the beauty of moving on revealed her dry humor. Laughter from the audience was contagious as Lassnig’s spirit came to life. </p>

		    <p>Former Lassnig art pupils and filmmakers Hans Werner Poschauko and Mara Mattuschka spoke on behalf of their restoration work and the relationships they had with Lassnig as students and friends. They studied at the Vienna University of Applied Arts under Lassnig from 1980 to 1990, becoming close friends with Lassnig and helping in her art studio. They protected her box of films until her death according to her wishes. These 8mm and 16mm films were carefully snipped, reordered, and taped based on past conversations with Lassnig and her notes. They described the process of aligning physical film strips to project her scenes in order.</p>

		    <p>“The most important part of making the final cut was finding how she wanted it, sometimes we really had to guess,” said Poschauko. She would always say, ‘Filming is looking with one eye.’ In this case, we had three eyes.”</p>

		    <p>They reflected on Lassnig’s intimate nature with her own work.</p>

		    <p>Mattuschka describes her original intentions stating, “These (the films) are more or less also, love stories.”</p>

		    <P>Both the films and two artists reflected on Lassnig’s passion towards the equality of women in the art world. While in New York, Lassnig founded the Women Artists Filmmakers Incorporated where she and other avant garde female filmmakers produced their own films and applied for grants. She lived alone for most of her life and never married, claiming that art was her only job, love, and occupation.</P>

		    <p>The Maria Lassnig Foundation, Poschauko and Mattuschka brought the past into the present. Lassnig’s films returned to the spotlight in the same city her films came alive in many decades ago. </p>

		    <p>“She always thought into the future,” said Mattuschka. “She never looked back.”</p>

		    <p><i>Mint</i> takes a closer look at photographer Stephen Shore, and the success of his current <a href="https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3769?gclid=Cj0KCQjw5qrXBRC3ARIsAJq3bwp1mU1U7A-T3FY-kJur3OoEoETf0lWjRIDo0QrckM9bx9hTlox1SWQaAmPvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">MoMa exhibit</a>. Shore documented Americana life through a wide variety of lenses, from disposable Polaroids to 3D photo and film. His dreamy, picturesque portrait of 20th century America resonates today. What made Shore's photography so strikingly elegant in its own raunchy way? Stephen's use of vibrant color bring the photo to life, provoking nostalgia. The quality of his photos are striking; almost as if they had been taking on a digital camera or iPhone. Stephen's eye for the future still runs steady. He currently posts work on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stephen.shore/" target="_blank">his Instagram account</a>, utilizing the apps of the future to continue producing abstract photography.</p>
