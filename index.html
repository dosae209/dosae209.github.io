    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a journalism and design student at Eugene Lang College at The New School University. I'm 18 years old and pursuing my career in writing as well as music recording. I believe that by pursuing my goals in a big city I can create the networks necessary to find a bigger voice for my work. 
      I am interested in writing on arts, culture, and humanitarian issues. I am currently studying the works of documentary photography and will begin my studies in exerpimental film and moving image media next semester. 
      I aspire to write and create for magazines to establish a natural dialogue between myself and readers that broaden perspective on current political and cultural climate. I also intend on releasing an EP with my original music. 
      My work and inspiration is constantly shifting so I am excited to see what art I produce throughout my time at the New School and beyond.</p>
